Hello! I am NTU, and I love tinkering with GNU/Linux systems.

Here you will find HOWTOs, various hints and tips, in-depth guides and work-arounds. I also cover a lot of different things regarding Linux in general (and now Windows) so don't be surprised if I upload something here that isn't covered in this description.

The main things I do are system maintenance, performance enhancements / tweaks, compiling error fixes, bug fixes, software development, system configuration, and many other things which come to mind. Please note that this is a volunteer effort so do not expect any guarantees.

I may be contacted at the following email addresses:

  1. neotheuser@ymail.com (Checked much more often and prefered)
  1. neotheuser@gmail.com

This page was created as a replacement for my wikispace page, formally known as http://neo-technical.wikispaces.com

I thought it would be a better idea to expand my various Linux hacks and such to a more professional site than wikispaces, so here I am!
