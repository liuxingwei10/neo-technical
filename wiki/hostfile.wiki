===Adobe===

Please note: I haven't touch a Mac in years so I cannot provide everything in deep detail. Following the on-screen instructions is generally what's going on here.


First, clean all previous installs of Adobe software.

The uninstaller is located in Applications/Utilities/Adobe Installers.

After uninstalling the Adobe suite, close all applications and restart your computer.

Download the clean-up utility provided by Adobe here:

http://download.macromedia.com/pub/creativesuite/cleanertool/mac/AdobeCreativeSuiteCleanerTool.dmg

Double-click the .dmg file and it will mount the AdobeCreativeSuiteCleanerTool.dmg file. It will be mounted in the name of "Adobe Creative Suite Cleaner Tool".

Accept the license agreement when prompted.

Select CS5-CS5.5 to be removed, or if the option of "Clean all" is provided, select that. The idea is to purge as much as possible from the system to ensure a clean installation of CS6.
