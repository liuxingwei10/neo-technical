==Enabling 8000, 11025, 16000, 22050, 32000, 88200, 96000, 176400, and 192000 Hz sample rates on _ALL_ C-MEDIA 8770 sound cards==

An awesome little work-around that I discovered after reverse-engineering the Windows drivers for the C-Media 8770... Currently, the HT Omega Striker 7.1 and all other 8770 chipset based sound cards only support 16-bit/44100 and 16-bit/48000. If you need or want 16/192000 or 16/96000 (or many others) then here's how!

===Developer's notes===

This is a Windows 7 hack and will not help Linux users achieve better (higher) sample rates.

This currently breaks surround sound playback. True surround sound and 2-channel to 5.1 or 7.1 does not work. I am hoping to fix this issue, or get the manufacturer to do so. It would be great to have this feature added to the official drivers. See note below.

I honestly have no idea why C-Media and HT Omega left out all the other sample rates when they work fine. I am hoping to try and reason with them.

44100 and 48000 Hz will still work and will not be broken or replaced by other sample rates. Only depreciated ;)


===HOWTO===

First, download the latest C-Media driver. The latest version is 8.17.42 (Provided exclusively by HT Omega) however there is very little difference (if any, from what I can see) between 8.17.42 and 8.17.40.
